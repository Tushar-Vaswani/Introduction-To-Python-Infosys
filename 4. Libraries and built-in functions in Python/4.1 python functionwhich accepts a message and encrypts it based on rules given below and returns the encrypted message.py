'''
Write a python function, encrypt_sentence(msg) which accepts a message and encrypts it based on rules given below and returns the encrypted message.

Words at odd position  -> Reverse It
Words at even position -> Rearrange the characters so that all consonants appear before the vowels and their order should not change

Note: Assume that the sentence would begin with a word and there will be only a single space between the words.
Perform case sensitive string operations wherever necessary.

Example: msg=the sun rises in the east    output=eht snu sesir ni eht stea
